Image Stitching
1. Take three photos by sweeping the camera from left to right and make sure the overlapped area > 50% between every two photos.
2. Name three photos, Image1, Image2, and Image3, and shrink the images if they are too big (e.g., use Windows Paint software to resize the image).
3. Create a new folder and put the provided ImageStitching.m and three images in it.
4. Use Matlab to open ImageStitching.m and change Line 30 to the directory of the folder where you saved three images.
5. Run ImageStitching.m
